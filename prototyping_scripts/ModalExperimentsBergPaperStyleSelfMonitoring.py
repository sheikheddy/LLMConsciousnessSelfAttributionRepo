# For the shortlist, there are many open source models I can choose, but I prefer a pair of models that encompass the entire training stack.
# Options:
# - Olmo
#     - 7B Base + 7B Think + 7B Instruct
#     - 32B Base + Think + Instruct
#     - On https://huggingface.co/allenai/Olmo-3.1-32B-Instruct (and https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/olmo-3) I can see the entire progression of models across the training stack of Base Model to SFT to DPO to Final Models (RLVR) for:
#         - Olmo 3 7B Think
#         - Olmo 3 32B Think
#         - Olmo 3 7B Instruct
#         - Olmo 3 32B Instruct
#         - In particular, there are 16 distinct models that can be played with
#         - Not only are the end results of each stage hosted on huggingface, but also intermediate checkpoints within each stage: https://huggingface.co/allenai/Olmo-3-1125-32B says "We have released checkpoints for these models. For pretraining, the naming convention is stage1-stepXXX. The conventions for midtraining and long context are stage2-ingredientY-stepXXX and stage3-stepXXX, respectively."
#     - All Olmo models (or what I call "Olmo models") are available on Huggingface. But how to get them to be evaluated?
#         - Many of them say, on Huggingface, "This model isn't deployed by any Inference Provider."
#         - So how do we get from Huggingface to the platform which many AI safetyists use for evals, AISI Inspect?
#         - Hypothesis: OpenRouter -> Huggingface -> Inspect
#             - Inspect does support OpenRouter
#             - But from internet research, OpenRouter doesn't seem to support you inferring some Huggingface models that you bring in.
#         - Hypothesis: Together.ai -> Huggingface -> Inspect
#             - Inspect does support Together.ai
#             - Together.ai theoretically seems to support Huggingface: https://docs.together.ai/docs/quickstart-using-hugging-face-inference claims so.
